                Our Mobile App is a financial wellness and workforce management
                solution that allows salaried employees ("you," "User," or
                "Employee") to access services such as Earned Wage Access (EWA)
                and other salary-linked financial benefits in partnership with
                employers and regulated financial institutions, including
                Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs). The App also enables
                employees to mark their attendance using geo-location tracking,
                where location is captured only at the time of punch-in and
                punch-out.
